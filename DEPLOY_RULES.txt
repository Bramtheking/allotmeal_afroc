IMPORTANT: Deploy Updated Firestore Rules
==========================================

The firestore.rules file has been updated to allow anonymous users to:
- Read M-Pesa pricing (mpesa_service_pricing)
- Read M-Pesa settings (mpesa_settings)  
- Read whitelist data (mpesa_whitelist)

TO DEPLOY:
1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to: Firestore Database â†’ Rules tab
4. Copy ALL content from: firestore.rules
5. Paste into the Firebase Console rules editor
6. Click "Publish"

Without deploying these rules, mobile users will still get permission errors!
